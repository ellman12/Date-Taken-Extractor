DTE V1.1
New Features
Added ability to write photo and video Date Taken metadata using the amazing command line program ExifTool. Can also remove Date Taken.
Added overloads of the DT reading methods that accept a FileStream. The original overloads that take string arguments now use a 'using' to safely open and close the files when done. 

Fixes and Improvements
AnalyzeFilename() can now catch a FormatException and if it does, returns null.

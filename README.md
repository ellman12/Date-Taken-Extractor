DateTakenExtractor (DTE) is a small, fast, simple library for reading and writing Date Taken metadata for photos and videos, with the library consisting of only a single ```static``` C# class.

This library came into existence because two separate projects of mine used the same classes/packages for finding this data, and trying to keep those two files the same was annoying and difficult. I also wanted to redo the class used in those two projects to be smaller, simpler, and better.

This library uses [MetadataExtractor](https://github.com/drewnoakes/metadata-extractor-dotnet) for reading metadata from files, and is essentially a greatly simplified wrapper around it meant for reading exclusively Date Taken metadata.
<br>[ExifTool](https://exiftool.org/) is a command line program used for writing metdata, and reading some metatada. It needs to be added to the `PATH` or in a folder in the `PATH` in order for it to work with DTE.

## Installing DateTakenExtractor
The easiest way to use this library is via its [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DateTakenExtractor/).

Either add this to your project file
```xml
<ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="DateTakenExtractor" Version="1.1.3"/>
</ItemGroup>
```

Or type this in Visual Studio's Package Manager Console:
```
PM> Install-Package DateTakenExtractor
```

Or search for `DateTakenExtractor` in the NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio or JetBrains Rider.

**DTE also REQUIRES [ExifTool](https://exiftool.org/).**
<br>To install ExifTool, download the .exe, rename it from `exiftool(-k).exe` to `exiftool.exe`, and add it to your `PATH` or move the exe to a directory already in the `PATH`, like `C:/Windows`.

## Using DateTakenExtractor
DateTakenExtractor is very simple to use. The class contains several public methods for your use.

```c#
using D = DateTakenExtractor.DateTakenExtractor;

//These methods can take either file paths as strings, or FileStreams.
//First checks the metadata, then the filename, for the Date Taken (DT) data. dateTakenSrc would either be 'Metadata', 'Filename', or 'None'.
DateTime? autoResult = D.GetDateTakenAuto("C:/yourfilehere.jpg", out DateTakenSrc dateTakenSrc);

//Checks only the metadata of the file for DT data. null if none found.
DateTime? metadataResult = D.GetDateTakenFromMetadata("C:/yourfilehere.jpg");

//Checks only the filename of the file for DT data. Notice the timestamp pattern ‚Üì in the filename. null if none found.
DateTime? filenameResult = D.GetDateTakenFromFilename("C:/IMG_20210320_175909.jpg");

//Attempt to get DT data from both the metadata AND the filename.
D.GetDateTakenFromBoth("C:/IMG_20210320_175909.jpg", out DateTime? metadataDT, out DateTime? filenameDT);

//New in V1.1: updating Date Taken metadata! This works for .jpg, .png, .mp4, and .mov files.
//.gif and .mkv files are iffy since they're not really meant to contain this kind of data.
D.UpdateDateTaken("C:/IMG_20210320_175909.jpg", new DateTime(2020, 6, 9, 12, 30, 0));
```

Date Taken metadata can come from two locations: the file's actual internal metadata, or its filename. If a DTE method can't find the Date Taken in the metadata or the filename, the return value/out parameter is set to `null`.
